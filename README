A Procedural Language in JavaScript powered by V8
=================================================

plv8 is a shared library that provides a PostgreSQL procedural language powered
by V8 JavaScript Engine.  With this program you can write in JavaScript your
function that is callable from SQL.

REQUIREMENT
-----------

plv8 is tested with:

- PG: version 8.4, 9.0, 9.1 and 9.2dev (maybe older are allowed)
- V8: version 3.6.2
- g++: version 4.5.1

Also all tools that PostgreSQL and V8 require to be built are required.

INSTALL
-------

Make sure V8 include files are in the system include directories, or you can
place them in $(PLV8DIR)/../v8/include.  Run make

  $ make install

and create language via

  $ psql -c 'CREATE EXTENSION plv8'

in 9.1, or in the prior versions

  $ psql -f plv8.sql

to create database objects.

TEST
----

plv8 supports installcheck test.  Make sure set custom_variable_classes = 'plv8'
in your postgresql.conf and

  $ make installcheck

EXAMPLE
-------

  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION plv8_test(keys text[], vals text[])
  RETURNS text AS $$
    var o = {};
    for(var i=0; i<keys.length; i++){
      o[keys[i]] = vals[i];
    }
    return JSON.stringify(o);
  $$ LANGUAGE plv8 IMMUTABLE STRICT;
  
  SELECT plv8_test(ARRAY['name', 'age'], ARRAY['Tom', '29']);
  SELECT plv8_test(ARRAY['name', 'age'], ARRAY['Tom', '29']);
           plv8_test        
  ---------------------------
   {"name":"Tom","age":"29"}
  (1 row)
